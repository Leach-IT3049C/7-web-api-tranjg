## Use Cases (How to test)

* Which Web API did you use, and where is it being used in the application?
I used Geolocation and OpenWeatherApp. Geolocation is used to retrieve the location (latitude and longitude coordinates), and OpenWeatherApp takes the current position and outputs your city, country, temperature, and weather condition.
* What are application use cases?
The application takes your current location and gives you your current weather status.

## Technical Write-up of selection of Web API selected:
Starting off, I used the Geolocation API, it takes your current location. It's only limited to your longitude and latitude coordinates. I also used the OpenWeatherApp which takes in your current location and gives your state, country, temperature, and weather status. In the context that I use this API, it's only limited to your current location and showing your country. The app as a whole only takes your current location into consideration.

## Self Reflection(s):
This is a really basic app, not super difficult, I'll probably add more, but I wanted to make sure my UI and general code was working.

## How long it took me/us to finish this:
3 hours
